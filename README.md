# **[Project 1: Mall Customers clustering: Project Overview]** 

For this project, I will build a clustering model (unsupervised Machine Learning model) to identify the pattern of customers from a mall and group them accordingly to their characteristics. By this, I will also get a dependent variable from the result and can be used in further analysis using Supervised ML Model.

-Users can predict the customers belong to which group by key in their characteristics.

-2 models(K-Means clustering and Hieratchical clustering) are implemented to idenitify the customer patterns.

-In order to visualise the data cleary, I only pick up 2 independent variables (annual incomes and spending scores) so that the result can be shown in a 2D graph. 

## **Result:**

Both of the models give different results.
